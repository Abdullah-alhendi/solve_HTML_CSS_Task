    <h1><p><u>what the introduction of math?</u></p></h1>
    <p><mark>Mathematics is the science and study of quality,</mark> 
     structure, space, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns,
     <b>formulate new conjectures,</b> 
     and establish truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately<i> chosen axioms and definitions.</i>

    <strong> There is debate over whether mathematical</strong><small> objects such as numbers and points exist naturally or are human creations.</small>
     The mathematician Benjamin Peirce called mathematics <del>"the science that draws necessary conclusions"</del>.
     Albert Einstein, on the other hand, 
     <u>stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality</u>,
     they are not certain; <mark> as far as they are certain</mark>, they do not refer to reality."</p>
