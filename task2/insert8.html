    <b><mark>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions</mark></b>, 
    called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks.
    [1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms,
    <u>step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages</u>.
      Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily
       intelligible to humans than machine code,
        <mark><b>which is directly executed by the central processing unit</b></mark>. 
        Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, 
    including knowledge of the application domain, 
    details of programming languages and generic code libraries,
     specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

<u>Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements</u>, 
testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), 
implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts,
 such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming,
  often the term software development is used for this larger overall process
   â€“ <b><mark>with the terms programming, implementation</mark></b>,
    and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se.
     Sometimes software development is known as software engineering,
      especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process.

        I was recently reading through comments on a Youtube video while eating my lunch (You know, like you do) and I came across one that got me thinking. It was a question from someone looking for guidance early in their coding journey, and concerned about the effects of a coming recession. It read:

        What if you are new? Like started coding 1 month ago? 0 experience. Trying to learn the basics of web dev currently. You don't have any job currently, and already started to burn through your savings. Any advice?
        
        This got me thinking about what I've learned in my career, the choices I have made, and how it could apply to this person's situation. I've been where this person is, more or less, and I truly feel for them. Granted, I'm not a professional dev and not in a hurry to get there, but I've had a "colorful" career so far, 
        that has led me to a good place and taught me a lot of lessons along the way.<br>
