            <h3>fish, any of approximately 34,000 species of vertebrate animals (phylum Chordata) 
                found in the fresh and salt waters of the world.
                 Living species range from the primitive jawless lampreys and hagfishes through 
                 the cartilaginous sharks, skates, and rays to the abundant and diverse bony fishes. 
                 Most fish species are cold-blooded; however, one species, the opah (Lampris guttatus), 
                 is warm-blooded.
